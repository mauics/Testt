"""
Windows Device Tracking Agent (Tray Version)
----------------------------------------------
Runs quietly in the system tray. Collects hardware stats + connected/internal
device info from this Windows PC and POSTs it to your central server every
REPORT_INTERVAL seconds. Also lets anyone report a problem with ANY PC in the
room (not just this one) via a small form from the tray menu.

All settings live in config.toml (same folder as this script) — nothing to
edit in the code itself when deploying to a new PC.

Requirements (install with pip):
    pip install psutil requests wmi pywin32 pystray pillow tomli

Run:
    python agent_windows.py
(tkinter and the console window are hidden automatically once running)
